### Tools & Applications
#### GIS (Geographical Information Systems)
[QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) is a free open source geographical information system. Using this we can visualize the ESRI data in LUCAS datasets. Documentation [link](https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/index.html)

[ARCGIS Maps SDK for .NET](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/) could be useful, if WPF or Blazor applicaitons are built, for visualization needs.

#### Data Analysis
For python notebooks, it is recommende to use a single virtual environment and analysis spread across multiple notebooks.
Some .net or other applications can be used for additional data integration and cleanup. **But update the gitignore file accordingly**
